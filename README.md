# DroidScript-Web

Framework which allows DroidScript apps to be converted into mobile and desktop HTML5 apps with virtually no code changes.

This library is useful in its own right to make development very easy for those who prefer the simplicity and flexibility of a procedural rather than a declarative approach to web development.

WARNING: This library is currently a work in progress and not yet suitable for a production environment
