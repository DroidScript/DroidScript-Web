* Filesystem:

* FIXME: FILE ../_index/Img/_index.png not found (Relative paths not resolved)
* Research using HTML5 manifest to pre-cache files and folders.

*   Change filesystem functions to rely on browser cache rather than localStorage (space too limited, inefficient)
*   - Limit HTML5 manifest to only pre-cache app files/folders, not system ones (unless override).
*   - Folders should be sync'd prior to startup, with file sync occurring in background.
*   - ListFolder should rely on already-sync'd folders before app starts
*   - ReadFile will have to use synchronous XHR but hopefully browser caching should mitigate delays.
*   Add support for /sdcard/DroidScript/* (except _index) redirecting (301) to /app, so browser cache will work effectively.
*   Add support for /sdcard/DroidScript/_index/*  redirecting 301 to /
*   Implement filesystem sync TO server.
* GUI:
*   Fix list colors, font sizes (_index for example)
*   Get <BACK> menu to work.
*   Add <MENU> button ||| to do the same thing as <BACK> menu on browsers that may block <BACK>
